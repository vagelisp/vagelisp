### Hi there 👋

I'm **Vagelis**, a **Freelance Full Stack Software Developer** from **Greece** 🇬🇷

I build modern web and mobile apps using technologies like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Vue**, **Astro**, **Strapi**, and more. 

I work with **agencies, startups, and enterprise clients around the globe**, helping them achieve their digital goals by turning ideas into fast, reliable, and scalable products. I focus on developer experience, performance, and clean architecture — and enjoy working across the entire stack, from UX to infrastructure.

I also **prototype electronics**, design **hardware-integrated solutions** using **microcontrollers like the ESP32**, and experiment with **3D printing** — blending code with the physical world to create smart tools, displays, and devices.

I'm an **Open Source contributor** and have built several plugins and tools, especially in the **WordPress** and **Strapi** ecosystems. I'm also a **WordCamp Speaker & Organizer**, passionate about growing and supporting developer communities.

Outside of tech, I’m into **running**, **food**, **video games**, and (yes) **more food** 🍜
