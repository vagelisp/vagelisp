### Hi there 👋

I'm **Vagelis**, a full stack software developer from **Greece** 🇬🇷

I build modern web and mobile apps using technologies like **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **React**, **Vue**, **Astro**, **Strapi** and more. I'm passionate about developer experience, performance, and clean architecture — and I enjoy working across the entire stack, from UX to infrastructure.

I also **prototype electronics**, design **hardware-integrated solutions** using **microcontrollers** (ESP8266, Arduino, etc.), and experiment with **3D printing** — blending code with the physical world to create smart tools, displays, and devices.

I'm an **Open Source contributor** and have built several plugins and tools, especially in the **WordPress** and **Strapi** ecosystems. I'm also a **WordCamp Speaker & Organizer**, passionate about growing and supporting developer communities.

Outside of tech, I’m into **running**, **food**, **video games**, and (yes) **more food** 🍜
